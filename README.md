### History

As a web developer, research the current state of market of the various company I work with is a day-to-day thing. It was like this, that while intending to enter to journalists' websites I discovered their low or almost non-existent use of websites.

A website is a tool that allows us to stand out among all the information found on the internet, It's almost like a modern business card. That a journalist lacks this tool is alarming, to say the least.

For being public figures and non-sensitive data, I decided to create this database with free access to the public.

With journalistDatabase a new field of research and analysis opens up for us.

This research, search, management, cleaning and analysis aims to make visible an important ignored niche, with which multiple conclusions can be reached.
